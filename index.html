							My experience while doing these courses are amazing. At the starting of MSIT I had little knowledge in coding and I was very nervous about whether I can do this course or not. But the mentors gave an excellent support in learning. MSIT is different from any other courses offered in college. Lot of courses have theory basis and less practicles but in MSIT we'll learn by doing it. It has helped me alot in learning the subject. It also helped me to do the things in corporate way. As a result, I enjoyed alot while learning the course and also gained practical experince by doing real world projects.
							<b>MSIT has played a big part in shaping my career.</b>
